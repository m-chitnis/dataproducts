Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

Part1: Shiny Application

1.Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github


Part2: Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Your presentation must satisfy the following

It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
It must be 5 pages
It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
